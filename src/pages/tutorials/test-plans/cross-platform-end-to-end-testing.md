End-to-end testing involves the testing of an application from start to end.  The objective of this testing is to simulate a real user scenario and validate the system under test and its components for integration and data integrity.

With cross-platform end-to-end testing, the application is tested from start to end on multiple platformsâ€“mobile and web.  

Let us take an example of a flight booking application.  
You might want to book a ticket through the desktop application and modify the booking details on an Android mobile application. Meanwhile, choose to cancel the booking on your iPad.

This will include the following steps:

* Book the flight on the desktop web.
* Modify the booking done in *step 1* on the Android application.
* Cancel the booking done in *step 1* and modified in *step 2*, on the iPad application.  

Today, users have the choice to use the same application across multiple devices,OS, and browsers. Hence, to ensure that your application provides your users similar experiences on multiple platforms, it must be tested on as many platforms as possible.
With Testsigma, you can test such cross-platform end-to-end testing scenarios easily.

> ## [Prerequisites](#pre-requisites)

To perform a cross-platform end-to-end testing on Testsigma, you should know the following: 
1. [Automate a test case in Testsigma](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/add-edit-delete/)  
2. [Create a test suite in Testsigma](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-suites/overview/)  
3. [Create a test plan in Testsigma](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-plans/overview/)

> ## [Steps to perform cross platform end-to-end testing](#steps to perform cross platform end-to-end testing)

**Create a test plan** 

1. Click on the **Test Development** icon on the left and navigate to **Test Plans**. This will take you to the **Test Plans** page.
2. On the test plans page, click **+Test Plan**, to create a new test plan.
3. Enter a meaningful **Name** of minimum of 4 characters and a **Description**(optional) for your test plan, on the text fields provided.
4. Click **Next**.
5. To switch the UI to the classic version, click the toggle **Switch to Classic UI** and jumpt to *step 13*.   
6. If you choose the latest version, follow the below steps. 
7. To add test suites to the test plan, click **Add Test Suites**.

8. On the Selected Test Suites window:  

    * Click the toggle **Enable End-To-end Testing**, to enable end-to-end testing.  
    * Select **Project** from the dropdown menu, to see the associated test suites.  
    * Select the test suites from the **Available Test Suites** list.  
    * Click **>>Add Selected**, to add the selected test suites to the test plan.  
    * Click **Add**, to add the test suites to the test plan.  
  
9. To select the environment to run the test suite against, select **Add Machine**.  
    * To run individual test suites on multiple environments, click **+Add Machine**,associated with each test suites.

10. You can either choose to create a new machine or choose to run the test suit on an existing environment.  
    * Select **Create New Machine**, to create a new machine.
    * Select **Add to Existing Machine**, to run the test suite on an existing machine.  

11. If you have selected **Create New Machine**, on the **Add Machine** pane:
    * Provide the following details:
        * **Name**: Name of the test environment should be a minimum of 4 characters.  
        * **Test Lab Type**: This option allows you to select the test lab your test suites are executed on. This includes your local device, the test lab plugins installed or the Testsigma cloud infrastructure. The test lab plugins include BrowserStack, Sauce Labs, Lambda Test, and so on.
        * **Prerequisites**: This is a condition or set of conditions to be met for the test suite to be executed.  
        * **Operating System**: Select the operating system to run the test suits.
        * **OS Version**: Select the operating system version.  
        * **Browser**: Select the browser.  
        * **Browser version**: Select the browser version.  
        * **Resolution**: Select the resolution of the device.  
    * Click the toggle **Headless Test**, to enable headless testing. (This option is available only on Google Chrome). *For more information,refer to [headless testing](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-plans/headless-testing/)*.![add the machine for e2e testing execution](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/test-plans/cross-platform-end-to-end-testing/add-machine.png)  

12. To add multiple test execution combinations (*test suite+ test machine*), repeat *step 6* to *step 10* and jump to *step 16*.

13. If you choose the classic UI follow the below steps,  
    * Select the **Testing Type** as **Distributed Testing**, to enable the cross-platform end-to-end testing feature. Distributed testing allows you to split your test suites across multiple test machines. In other words, enabling cross platform end-to-end testing. *For more information,refer to [distributed testing](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-plans/distributed-testing/)*.
