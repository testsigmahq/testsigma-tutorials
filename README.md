# Testsigma Tutorials
Testsigma docs are built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and deployed to [https://testsigma.com/tutorials/](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/).

&emsp; 

## **Getting started with Testsigma Tutorials**
Testsigma documentation helps you from the basics to more specific tutorials & how-tos.

This project contains step-by-step and detailed explanations for many test automation use cases/scenarios.

We are working hard to keep our tutorials up to date. However, we might not be able to cover everything. If you think we need to include something here, create an issue [here](https://github.com/testsigmahq/testsigma-tutorials/issues)! Alternatively, you can send an email to [community@testsigma.com](mailto:community@testsigma.com), and weâ€™ll work on it with you.
